  **Common Deer was founded on the idea that life is better with a bit of character.**

  We also believe that “cheap” is actually quite expensive… in the long run.

  So, we’re obsessed with awesome things that make us feel good. We comb vintage sales, auctions, craft fairs, etsy, and more to find products worthy of our Common Deer stamp. We love small business, small batch production and products that are USA-made, eco-friendly, fair-trade, re-purposed, or vintage. As we grow, we are working towards having our entire collection fit those buzz words. We know that with your help in supporting small business, new designers, artisans, and craftspeople it will result in collective success.

  We want you to feel great about the products you purchase, how you decorate your home, and the gifts you give. At our core is the exploration of how it is made, the people behind the product, and why. The story is what sells us – and we encourage you to think more about “the story” behind what you’re purchasing even outside of Common Deer.
