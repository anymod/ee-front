            <h4 class="media-heading">Choose an Advertising Objective</h4>
            <p>Once you are logged in to Facebook, visit the <a href>Facebook Advertising site</a>.</p>
            <p>Select the “Create Ad” button. You will now be asked to choose an objective for your advertising campaign.</p>

Choose from the following options:


As an advertiser for your eeosk store there are four main advertising objectives that you will want to choose from:

Send people to your website:
Use this to increase the number of visits to your eeosk store. This option focuses on driving traffic to your eeosk store. While this option does not guarantee increased sales, it will send more traffic to your store, and the more potential customers you send to your store, the more likely you are to make a sale.

Increase conversions on your website:
Use this when you want people to take a specific action on your website such as buying a product. This option allows you to track whether people actually bought something from your eeosk store after viewing your ad. In order for this advertising option to be most effective, you will need to have a significant advertising budget to properly track all conversions.

Boost your posts:
Use this option when you want to get a post from your eeosk store’s Facebook Page in front of more people who can then read, like, or share the post with their friends. Boosting a post allows you to advertise your store while also building your brand by promoting content that reflects your sense of home design and expertise. This option focuses on getting Facebook users to interact with the Facebook post itself, not on sending traffic to your eeosk store. However, as more people like and share your posts, the more new potential customers may learn about your business and visit your store.

Promote your Page:
Use this option to promote your brand and gain more Facebook fans of your store’s Facebook Page. Getting more Facebook fans of your store Page will mean that more people will see your future posts in their Facebook news feeds so your store can stay top-of-mind. This objective focuses on building your Facebook following and does not focus on sending traffic to your eeosk store. However, the more Facebook fans you have, the more likely they are to visit your store as potential customers.

We recommend you begin with a Facebook Ad to send people to your website as this will attract more visitors to your eeosk store, and the more visitors you have, the more likely you are to make a sale. Learn more about creating this ad here.
